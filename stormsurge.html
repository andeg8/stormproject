      <h3>What is a Storm Surge?</h3>
      <p>A storm surge is a rise in sea level that occurs during before and after the core of the storm.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>How storm surge's are formed.</h3>
    <p>Storm surges are created in deep waters by the circulation of the hurricane creating a vortex. When the hurricane moves into shallow waters the vortex can't go down, so it goes up making really big waves.</p>
    <h3>What storm surges can do in a short amount of time.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Extreme Flooding</li>
      <li>High Winds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How storm surges can affect you.</h3><br>
    <p>A storm surge can flood your house quickly and even kill you if you get stuck inside.</p><br>
    <p>Another way people die is when they try to take videos of storm surges because after the first few waves the water level rises.</p><br>
    <p>If you are ever caught in a Storm Surge get to higher ground and take cover.</p>
